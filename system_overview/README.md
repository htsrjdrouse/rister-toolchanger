# Rister Multi-Modal Toolchanger - System Overview

This directory contains visual documentation of the complete Rister Multi-Modal Toolchanger system, showcasing the integration of FDM printing, liquid dispensing, and camera imaging capabilities within a single Klipper-based platform.

## System Architecture

The Rister Multi-Modal Toolchanger represents a paradigm shift from traditional single-purpose 3D printers to a comprehensive manufacturing and analysis platform. The system seamlessly integrates three distinct tool types:

### **Multi-Modal Integration**
- **FDM Tools (E0, E1)**: High-precision 3D printing with Bambu Lab hotends
- **Liquid Dispenser (L0)**: Automated pipette handling with precision volume control  
- **Camera Tool (C0)**: Programmable focus imaging for quality control and analysis

### **Enhanced Gantry Design**
- **4-Motor Z-Axis**: Improved stability compared to standard 3-motor configurations
- **Custom CoreXY Motor Mounts**: Enhanced rigidity for multi-modal operations
- **Optimized Tool Spacing**: Accommodates diverse tool geometries and dock mechanisms

### **Unified Control System**
- **Klipper Firmware**: Native integration with custom Python modules
- **Mixed Communication**: CAN bus for extruders, MQTT for camera, direct GPIO for liquid handling
- **Comprehensive Sensor Network**: Real-time tool state monitoring and validation
